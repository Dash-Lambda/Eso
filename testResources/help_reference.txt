Runtime Parameters...
- appendInp     	= false	(append console input to the end of file input (useful for some self-interpreters))
- bfDiv         	= true 	(toggle whether or not divison by 0 evaluates to 0 in Befunge-98)
- bfRetCode     	= false	(toggle whether or not the Befunge-98 return code is displayed)
- cache         	= true 	(cache initialized state of programs for faster repeated loading)
- debug         	= false	(toggle debug information for the interface and languages that support it)
- dfChar        	= true 	(toggle whether or not to print Deadfish output as char values)
- dyn           	= false	(resize tape as needed for BF interpreter to eliminate memory limitations)
- echoFileInp   	= false	(print file input to the console as it is used, makes it look as if the input was entered into the console directly)
- fPtr          	= true 	(toggle whether output for P'' programs starts at the read head going right or at the end of the tape going left)
- indent        	= false	(toggle whether or not to neatly indent generated Scala code)
- log           	= false	(toggle detailed console logging)
- normLineBreaks	= true 	(normalize all line breaks to '\n' when reading source files (for instance, '\r\n' => '\n'))
- pNull         	= false	(toggle whether to print the null/empty character in the output of P'' programs)
- preludePar    	= false	(run Prelude voices in parallel, can speed up execution of some programs)
- printNum      	= false	(print output as numerical values rather than characters)
- sHead         	= true 	(toggle whether the read head starts at the beginning of the initial tape or the right end of the tape for P'')
- time          	= false	(print program duration on completion)
- bfOpt         	= 2    	(BrainFuck interpreter selection: 0=base, 1=optimized, 2=compiled)
- charWidth     	= 8    	(bit width of input characters for languages that do bitwise I/O)
- fileEOF       	= 0    	(character value to end file input strings with)
- init          	= 40000	(initial tape size for interpreters with a data tape)
- methSize      	= 1000 	(maximum number of blocks in a generated method (for compiling interpreters)
- olen          	= -1   	(maximum output length, useful for non-terminating programs, -1=infinite)
