Ramshackle Hut

You are standing inside your ramshackle wooden hut. The squalor here has
replaced the comfort and grandeur of your former royal palace. In one corner
near the north door leading to your garden lies the pile of straw you use as
a bed. Fixed in place by an unknown magic, next to a small table, is a wooden
mockery of your former throne. The main door to the east leads outside to a
road.

You can see:
  a small wooden box of matches sitting on the table (2)

>
Dirt Patch

This patch of dirt and weeds bears no comparison to the lush gardens and
lawns of your former palace; you know that the dry cracked earth here will
bear no more fruit. A breeze from the west brings the stagnant odour of a
once lively pond.

You can see:
  a rusty old lamp lying discarded on the ground (1)

>
Stagnant Pond

The yard continues to a small area containing only a stagnant pool of water.
This pond, once teeming with life, is now a mess of brown sludge and green
algae. In the distance across the farm of your neighbour you can see a small
village.

You can see:
  the body of a dead fish, in the reeds around the pond (5)

>Yeugh, rotten fish does not taste good...

Frankly, it's poisonous.
